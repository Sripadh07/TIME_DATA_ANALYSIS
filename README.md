# TIME_DATA_ANALYSIS
- Reading csvfile.
- Segregated time using 'to_datetime' function.
- Using 'groupby' function I grouped time data and applied rank_volume function.
- In that function sorted data according to dates are taken and given them a rank and this rank column is attached to original data and indexes are reset accordiing to that.
