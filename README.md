# TIME_DATA_ANALYSIS
- Reading csvfile.
- Segregated time using 'to_datetime' function.
- Using 'groupby' function I grouped time data and applied rank_volume function.
- In that function  at first current date is taken from the data of same group here I selected first row as the group contains same date and time.
- And then last 5 days of that date are taken selecting the date from the data in such a way that the date is in the duartion which is last 5 days and time according to it.and ranking of those groups according to volume has done.
